# Login Page with CSS Animations and localStorage

This project is a simple login page implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features smooth CSS animations and uses the browser's localStorage to remember the username for a better user experience.

## Features

- Responsive login form with username and password fields.
- CSS animations for button clicks and message display.
- Stores the username in localStorage to pre-fill the username field on subsequent visits.
- Background image for aesthetic appeal (requires the image file `Laptop and papers aesthetic.jpeg`).

## Usage

1. Open the `login.html` file in any modern web browser.
2. Enter your username and password.
3. Click the "Log In" button.
4. The username will be saved and pre-filled the next time you open the page.
5. A welcome message will be displayed briefly after login.

## Notes

- Ensure the background image file `Laptop and papers aesthetic.jpeg` is located in the same directory as `login.html` for the background to display correctly.
- This is a front-end only login page and does not include any backend authentication.
